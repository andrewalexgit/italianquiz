# italianquiz

This program is a good example of what can be done to the FlashCards class. In this case I have modified it and added some simple features to create a sophisticated Italian to English learning flash card engine.

Some features include:

(1) Italian to English flash cards
(2) English to Italian flash cards
(3) Automatically identifies verbs in flash cards
(4) Verb drill flash card generation
(5) Answer checker methods for both Italian to English, and English to Italian
(6) Scoring system
